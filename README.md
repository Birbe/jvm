# JVM-Rust

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-f39f37) ![Rust](https://github.com/Birbe/jvm/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

___

A pure Rust implementation of the JVM 7 spec, with the main goals being to be able to eventually:

- Run the unmodified OpenJDK 7 Java source
- Run in a WASM environment

There are currently two modes of execution, but they are both highly incomplete.

- Interpreted mode
- Bytecode ðŸ – WASM compilation

The WASM compiler is still under a lot of work, but works with some extremely simple bytecode. Control flow is the
most difficult part, and that part of the code probably needs to be cleaned up a lot.

## Roadmap

#### Classloader status

- [x] Deserialize Java 7 classes
- [ ] Type-checking of the bytecode (!)
- [x] Cleanup the deserialization code

Currently, none of the code is type-checked, so only input Java that you trust.

#### Interpreter roadmap

- [x] Get basic bytecode running in interpreted mode
- [x] Get heap allocation and object creation working
- [ ] Basic stop-the-world garbage collection
- [ ] Get the OpenJDK 7 source to load and run.
  
#### WASM roadmap

- [x] Get basic bytecode compiled to WASM
- [ ] Control flow *
- [ ] Get heap allocation working
- [ ] Basic stop-the-world garbage collection

*: see technical constraints

## Library Usage

Interpreted mode

```Rust
let classpath_root = PathBuf::from("path to root of compiled classes");

let vm = VirtualMachine::new(classpath_root);

vm.class_loader.borrow_mut().load_and_link_class("classpath of main class");

vm.spawn_thread(
    String::from("Main thread"), 
    "Main", //classpath
    "main", 
    "([Ljava/lang/String;)V", //method returns void, takes String[]
    vec![ //String arguments
        String::from("String arguments!")
    ]
);

let mut mut_thread = vm.threads.get_mut("Main thread").unwrap();

while mut_thread.get_stack_count() > 0 {
    match mut_thread.step() {
        Ok(_) => {}
        Err(e) => panic!(format!("JVM errored while stepping! Error:\n{:?}", e))
    }
}
```

Or, run the jvm_test package

```
cargo run -p jvm_test -- --mode [Mode]
```

Mode: i (interpreted) OR wasm (compile to wasm and execute with Wasmtime)

## Technical Constraints

#### Control flow

Java bytecode uses arbitrary goto/jump instructions, which does not directly
map to WASM. WASM uses a static block format, where you define sets of instructions,
of which you can then run commands to go to.

#### Classloaders

Due to the (current!) lack of actual support for dynamic linking within WASM,
user-defined classloaders will not work (within WASM compilation mode). It might technically be possible
to support dynamic classloading without dynamic linking, but it would have massive
overhead as it would hypothetically require generating a new WASM
module for every class, and having them all function together through JavaScript, which would be massively slow.

#### JIT/Interpreted mode

Due to the current lack of stable support for dynamic linking in WASM,
it's not possible to have a mixed execution mode like you can find in the Oracle JVM,
which is able to gather statistics on hotspots within bytecode, and JIT them to native code
to have them run faster. As JITed code should essentially always run faster, however, this feature is probably useless.
